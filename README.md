# explorea-event-manager
The aliens have finaly showed themselves up and it's seems they would like to share some knowledge, their planet and even some tea time with us. The Earthers turned up to be very keen on getting to know them to so web apps like Explorea would likely help both sides to keep in touch and organize.


Explorea is an imaginary event managing app based on React, Vanilla and Sass. Flexbox provides basic responsivenes.

The project is currently at the beginning of developement phase but an overall idea is easliy noticable. 

Explorea covers:

<ul>
    <li>custom event adding (click 'new' in nav bar, basic form validation included)</li>
    <li>event edit/remove (buttons show on event hover; click on category icon to change it (text will be added to each icon))</li>
    <li>category search 
        <ol>
        <li>In the navbar choose explorea/browse</li>
        <li>Click on the planet to display categories</li>
        <li>Choose your category</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>filter by event name
            <ol>
        <li>In the navbar choose explorea/browse</li>
        <li>Click on the planet to activate input field</li>
        <li>Type event name</li>
        <li>Click 'search' or press Enter </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>basic responsivenes</li>
</ul>
